# Function Basics
The Odin Project -- JavaScript Basics: Function Basics

Let’s write some functions! Write these in the script tag of a skeleton HTML file. If you’ve forgotten how to set it up, review our instructions [on how to run JavaScript code.](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-fundamentals-part-1#how-to-run-javascript-code)

For now, just write each function and test the output with `console.log`.

1. Write a function called `add7` that takes one number and returns that number + 7.

2. Write a function called `multiply` that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.

3. Write a function called `capitalize` that takes a string and returns that string with only the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.

4. Write a function called `lastLetter` that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
  <br>&#8226;`lastLetter("abcd")` should return `"d"`
